# Introduction to Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)

Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) is a discipline that incorporates aspects of software engineering and applies them to infrastructure and operations problems. The main goals are to create scalable and highly reliable software systems.

## Core Principles
1. **Embracing Risk**: Reliability is not about 100% uptime; it's about finding the right balance between velocity and stability.
2. **Service Level Objectives (SLOs)**: Defining the level of reliability required for a service and measuring it.
3. **Eliminating Toil**: Toil is manual, repetitive work that provides no long-term value. SREs aim to automate these tasks.
4. **Monitoring and Observability**: You cannot manage what you cannot measure. Systems must expose metrics to reflect their health.
5. **Automation**: Replacing manual intervention with software to improve consistency and speed.
6. **Release Engineering**: Ensuring that software is built and deployed in a reproducible and reliable way.
7. **Simplicity**: Reducing complexity in the system to improve reliability and maintainability.

## The Role of an SRE
An SRE spends up to 50% of their time on "ops" (tickets, on-call, manual work) and the other 50% on "dev" (automation, feature development, improving the system). This balance ensures that the operational load doesn't overwhelm the engineering efforts.
