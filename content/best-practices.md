# SRE Best Practices: On-call, Incident Response, and Post-mortems

Reliability is not just about writing code; it's about the entire lifecycle of a service.

## On-call Health
On-call work is a critical part of being an SRE. It's about being responsible for the availability and performance of a service.
- **Goal**: Minimize the number of on-call rotations and provide adequate support for the on-call person.
- **Strategies**: Reduce toil, automate responses, and use monitoring tools to alert on-call people of potential issues before they become critical.

## Incident Response
Incident response is the process of detecting, managing, and resolving incidents.
- **Incident Commander (IC)**: The person in charge of managing the incident.
- **Communication**: Clear communication between the IC and other team members is crucial for a successful resolution.
- **Alerting**: Automated alerting systems should notify the IC of potential issues before they become incidents.

## Post-mortems
A post-mortem is a process of learning from incidents and using that knowledge to improve the reliability of a service.
- **Goal**: Identify the root cause of an incident and develop a plan for preventing it in the future.
- **Blameless Culture**: The goal is to learn from the incident and not assign blame.
- **Action Items**: Post-mortems should lead to clear and actionable items that improve the reliability of the system.

## The Importance of Reliability
Reliability is the most important feature of any service. Without it, users will not trust your service and will seek alternatives.
- **User Experience**: Reliability is a direct reflection of the user experience.
- **Business Impact**: A reliable service is essential for the success of a business.
- **SRE Culture**: Promoting a culture of reliability throughout the organization is crucial for building and maintaining highly reliable systems.
